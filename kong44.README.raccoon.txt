Name of script: kong44_Evaluate_Raccoon_Life.py

Description:
The script first imports needed libraries.
The input file is read in and separated into rows (contained in a list).
This list is split so that the headers and "dead or alive" message are removed. 
The resulting matrix is transformed so that everything is in column format. 
Transformed matrix is turned into a dictionary so keywords can be accessed.
Dictionary is populated with tuples so they are converted into lists with the correct data type. 
final_dictionary is the single, compiled dictionary with all the correct keywords and data types.
Three functions are written to calculate average, sum, and difference between points. 
Functions are given inputs and new variables are created as an output to store data. 
Movement data (distance calc) is made into a dictionary and added to compiled dictionary. 
Raccoon name is extracted from input data. 
Output file is created and header and data is written to it.
